# Courses-Summaries
This repo contains several summaries I made while studying topics mainly in robotics and control systems.

# Kinematics & Dynamics: Differential Drive Vehicles, Omniwheels, and Quadcopters
As a robotics enthusiast, I've recognized a gap in my knowledge concerning certain aspects of robotics, particularly in areas like Differential Drive and Omniwheels Vehicles, as well as quadcopters. While I've developed a strong understanding of robot arm kinematics and can implement models with ROS, I realized the importance of diving deeper into these other areas to gain a comprehensive grasp of robot control.

 # PID Control
While I've explored PID controllers before, Brian's approach in the MATLAB Tech Talk series offered a fresh perspective. He not only elucidated the technical intricacies of each gain but also provided insightful analogies that made the concepts truly resonate with me. This has undoubtedly become my preferred method of understanding PID control. Moreover, beyond the theoretical framework, Brian also adeptly covered practical methods for tuning the PID Controller, highlighting the advantages of each approach.

  # Systems Engineering
Systems Engineering has always been a fascinating subject for me. However, I often notice that job postings for systems engineers vary significantly in their requirements and responsibilities. I enrolled in this course to gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of systems engineering, and it has been incredibly effective in achieving that goal. 
The course topics were: 
- What is Systems Engineering?
- Towards a Model-Based Approach.
- The Benefits of Functional Architectures.
- An Introduction to Requirements
- Some Benefits of Model-Based Systems Engineering.
