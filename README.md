# Kinematics & Dynamics: Differential Drive Vehicles, Omniwheels, and Quadcopters
As a robotics enthusiast, I've recognized a gap in my knowledge concerning certain aspects of robotics, particularly in areas like Differential Drive and Omniwheels Vehicles, as well as quadcopters. While I've developed a strong understanding of robot arm kinematics and can implement models with ROS, I realized the importance of diving deeper into these other areas to gain a comprehensive grasp of robot control.

 # PID Control
While I've explored PID controllers before, Brian's approach in the MATLAB Tech Talk series offered a fresh perspective. He not only elucidated the technical intricacies of each gain but also provided insightful analogies that made the concepts truly resonate with me. This has undoubtedly become my preferred method of understanding PID control. Moreover, beyond the theoretical framework, Brian also adeptly covered practical methods for tuning the PID Controller, highlighting the advantages of each approach.

  # Systems Engineering
Systems Engineering has always been a fascinating subject for me. However, I often notice that job postings for systems engineers vary significantly in their requirements and responsibilities. I enrolled in this course to gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of systems engineering, and it has been incredibly effective in achieving that goal. 
The course topics were: 
- What is Systems Engineering?
- Towards a Model-Based Approach.
- The Benefits of Functional Architectures.
- An Introduction to Requirements
- Some Benefits of Model-Based Systems Engineering.

# Swarm Robotics: A Formal Approach Book notes 
This is an interesting book for learning swarm robotics and getting to know many basics. I gathered several research papers, and textbooks covering different aspects of swarm robotics, and looked into various projects involving swarm robots. I believe these resources can be helpful for anyone just starting to learn about the field and wanting to understand the basics of swarm robots.

# IELTS 
I undertook the IELTS examination, a prerequisite for several applications. Facing the challenge of a tight timeframe, I devoted a mere 5 days to familiarize myself with the exam's intricacies. To my delight, the outcome exceeded expectations with a commendable total score of 7.5 (Reading: 9.00, Listening: 8.5, Writing: 6.5, Speaking: 6.5). While I consider myself fortunate for the favorable result, I observed a prevailing perception that such an achievement was nearly unattainable. Reflecting on the exam's structure, I perceive it to be like any other assessment, comprising both technical knowledge and strategic techniques.
