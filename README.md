# Courses-Summaries
This repo contains several summaries I made while studying topics mainly in robotics and control systems.

## Kinematics & Dynamics: Differential Drive Vehicles, Omniwheels, and Quadcopters
As a robotics enthusiast, I've recognized a gap in my knowledge concerning certain aspects of robotics, particularly in areas like Differential Drive and Omniwheels Vehicles, as well as quadcopters. While I've developed a strong understanding of robot arm kinematics and can implement models with ROS, I realized the importance of diving deeper into these other areas to gain a comprehensive grasp of robot control.
